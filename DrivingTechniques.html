        <p id="As">As one would assume, some of the more important things
         needed to master a game are the Techniques and Strats in the game.
        On this page, I will go over all the important Driving Techniques and Strats
        needed in Chocobo GP.</p>

    <H2>The Starting Boost</H2>
    
    <p>In order to start a race off well, having a good Starting Boost is really important
     There are 2 kinds of Starting Boosts that you can get in this game. </p>

     
    <h3>Great Start</h3>
        <p>A "Great Start" in Chocobo GP is defined as getting a Starting Boost that will only
            last for about 1 second. This will happen when
            a player doesn't hold the "A" Button right when the 'count down' shows the number "2" but
            instead presses it a little after the "2" shows up. Here's a Demo of a 'Great Start'. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1J6n6GSnDo/">Demo</a></p>

            

        <h3>Perfect Start</h3>
        <p>A "Perfect Start" in Chocobo GP is defined as getting a Starting Boost that will last
            for about 2 seconds. This is achieved when a player holds the "A" button as soon as the
            'count down' shows the number "2". With practice, any player can achieve it easily.
            Here is a Demo of a 'Perfect Start.' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGORb0hTX80">Demo</a>

<section id="Trick">
    <h2>Tricking</h2>

    <p>Another important thing needed to go fast in Chocobo GP is Tricking
        or Jump Boosting as some people like to call it. This is done when a player
     presses the "R1" button right before going off a Cliff or Ramp that is on the track.
     There are two possible "Tricks" that can be achieved in Chocobo GP.
     They are called: "Great Trick" and "Perfect Trick"
    </p>

    <ul>
        <h3>Great Trick</h3>
        <p>When a player gets a "Great Trick", they will see a "Great Trick" animation
            show up on their screen indicating they have achieved it. This is a simple
            thing to do as all the player needs to do is press the "R1" button in the middle
            of the cliff or ramp. Here is a Demo of a "Great Trick." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qm8jvRdtKk/">Demo</a>
        </p>
       <h3>Perfect Trick</h3>
        <p>While "Great Tricks" are good to get, "Perfect Tricks" are even better to achieve
            due to the player getting a longer boost on the Ground afterwards. To achieve this,
            the player must press the "R1" button as late as possible on a ramp or cliff with out. If achieved,
            the player will see a "Perfect Trick" animation show up on their Screen. This can be pretty tricky at first but with practice, it'll become easier. Here is a Demo of a 
            "Perfect Trick." <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP9HwHrM3g8/">Demo</a>

<section id="Drifting">
    <h2>Drifting</h2>

    <p>As in any Karting Game, Drifting is a key essential to going fast in Chocobo GP. It is defined as jumping and holding the "R1"
        Button while turning in a Specific Direction. While Drifting the player can get what is know as a Mini Turbo, which is a Boost that is
        achieved after drifting for a certain period of time. There are 3 Levels of Mini Turbos that can be achieved in Chocobo GP.
      </p>

      
       <h3>Mini Turbo<h3>
            <p>A single Mini Turbo occurs when you see Yellow sparks form while drifing.</p>
        <h3>Super Mini Turbo</h3>
        <p>A single Mini Turbo occurs when you see Pink sparks form while drifing. This will give the player an even longer boost than a Mini Turbo. </p>
        <h3>Ultra Mini Turbo</h3>
        <p>A single Mini Turbo occurs when you see Blue sparks form while drifing. This will give the player an even longer boost than a Super Mini Turbo.</p>
      

      <p>Here is a Demo Video that Demonstrates Drifting as well as all 3 Mini Turbo Boosts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm0yeN0iQvA/">Demo</a> </p>

<section id="Offroad">
    <h2>Offroad</h2>

    <p>Offroad in Chocobo GP is very interesting in my opinion. In most Racing Games, the Offroad will slow the player down if you drive or drift over it
        normally.The same thing applies to Chocobo GP with the exception of a few Characters in the Game. (See the Characters Page). However, in Chocobo GP, after
        performing a trick or going over a boost panel, the player can temporarily go over the grass or offroad for the duration of the boost that you get. But once the boost from
        a boost panel or trick runs out, the player will slow down. Here is a Demonstration. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3WKiW_nmF4/">Demo</a>
