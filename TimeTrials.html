       <p>Time Attack is my personal favorite mode in this Game. I have put majority of my
            gameplay hours here. I have and still currently hold several World Records(WR) for many of the Tracks.
            Time Attack in this game is pretty simple. The player will choose a Character and will have 3 Laps to race around a certain track of their
            choice as fast as you can, choosing from 2 Speed Classes: 'Beginner Speed' or 'Master Speed'. 
        </p>

    <ul>
           <li><h2>Beginner Speed </h2></li><img class="pic" src="Beginner.png"
            <p>As one would guess, this speed is the slowest of the two. This speed is perfect for players that are new to the game and want to get
                a proper feel for the game, however, as a competitive Time Trialer for both speeds, I'd say this speed requires a different playstyle due to the different
                strategies used for each speed. For example, there are certain shortcuts that can be taken compared to Master Speed, vise-versa.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Master Speed </h2></li><img class="pic" src="Master.png" 
            <p>Master Speed is the fastest of the two classes. This speed is recommended for players that want a challenge and are comfortable with the 
                mechanics and gameplay. Keep in mind, this class requires a completely different playstyle compared to Beginner Speed such as taking more shortcuts.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <p>Each Track also has a Staff Ghost time to beat. Beating these times will award Tickets that can then be used to buy Characters and Vehicles, etc.</p>
